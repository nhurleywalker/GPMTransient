# Lag analysis

This directory contains code to run a preliminary lag analysis to stitch together pulses that occur in multiple observations.

Generate modified lightcurves by running
```
python lag_analysis.py
```
After running, this folder should now contain files whose filenames have the pattern `[obsid]_lightcurve_mod.txt`.
