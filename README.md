## Analyses

Each recipe below corresponds to a different folder within this one.
In some cases, the subfolder has its own `README.md` with more in-depth instructions.

Some subfolders are prerequisites for others, according to the following diagram:

To re-make the flowchart:

```
dot -Tpng flowchart.dot > flowchart.png
```

The listed command(s) are inteded to be run in the corresponding subfolder.
In all of the below, if there are `make` commands, you can use the `-j` command to parallelise execution.

### Results

Some (not necessarily all) of the final figures and tables that result from the above analyses are also git-tracked.
Such files are kept in the `upload_materials` folder so that they do not clash with the files generated by the analysis scripts.

If the analysis scripts are changed in any way that affects the results, the way to affirm the new results is to copy the relevant file(s) into the `upload_materials` folder and overwrite the previous version.
